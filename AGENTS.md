# Workspace Agent Routing

PRD-Creator is repository-backed system memory. Current explicit user intent and current repository/project authority outrank chat history. Use the smallest owner and proof set that can settle the task.

## Canonical workflow names

Use these names everywhere in current policy, routing, handoff, and user-facing explanation:

```text
Project Setup
→ Project Requirements
→ PRD Production
   └─ Production Assets when required
→ PRD Handoff
→ Voice Requirements when Voice is justified
→ Voice Production
→ Voice Delivery
```

Numeric labels are not workflow names. Numeric prefixes in `docs/foundation/` are file-ordering only. Numeric markers in generated PRD navigation are document-section ordinals only; the capability name is always **Production Assets**.

Do not reintroduce numbered stage aliases in current operating documentation.

## Core routing

| Intent | Mode | Start |
|---|---|---|
| Inspect, understand, recover, decide | Plan | current state + smallest owner; read-only unless change requested |
| Create/revise project PRD or Voice deliverables | Production Execution | matching semantic specialist only when needed + smallest active owner |
| Change PRD-Creator policy, workflow, approved Golden/design system, renderer, validator, schema, tooling, repository mechanics | Development | `development-brief` + exact owner |
| Fix bounded bug, regression, stale routing/docs, behavior-preserving defect | Maintenance | concrete failure or explicit target → first wrong owner |

Production work does not become Development merely because tools or generated files are involved. There is one authority, quality, and proof system; task size changes scope, not standards.

## Boot

### Observe / recover

```text
AGENTS.md
→ CONTEXT.md
→ docs/knowledge/next-action.md
→ smallest owner needed
→ report current understanding
→ STOP
```

Read `GITHUB_RULES.md` only when GitHub mutation/history/CI/promotion behavior can affect the task.

### Maintenance / bounded change

```text
concrete failure or explicit target
→ first wrong owner
→ exact owner
→ GITHUB_RULES.md before material GitHub mutation
→ smallest falsifiable proof
→ STOP
```

### Development

```text
AGENTS.md
→ CONTEXT.md
→ docs/knowledge/next-action.md
→ development-brief
→ exact owner
→ GITHUB_RULES.md before material GitHub mutation
```

### Production Execution

```text
new / materially uncertain project meaning
→ project-document-production when semantic judgment is needed
→ Project Requirements

bounded approved PRD revision
→ smallest changed canonical owner
→ only invalidated downstream owners

PRD presentation-only issue with correct meaning
→ document/DESIGN-CONTRACT.md
→ exact implementation owner when required

Voice meaning / communication / performance work
→ voice-production when semantic craft judgment is needed
→ Voice Requirements | Voice Production | Voice Delivery as appropriate
```

Do not broad-read the repository or replay the complete workflow for bounded work.

## Authority

Use the nearest authority for each claim:

1. current explicit user instruction;
2. approved project-specific decisions;
3. authoritative project source;
4. normalized current project/requirement state;
5. accepted canonical PRD / Voice source for downstream scope;
6. durable repository/foundation policy;
7. active package procedure;
8. Golden/reference material for demonstrated representation/quality only;
9. generated output, reviews, Git history, and chat as supporting evidence.

Material conflicts remain `UNKNOWN` until reconciled. Golden/reference material never supplies another project's facts.

## First wrong owner

```text
project/source meaning wrong                → Project Requirements
canonical PRD meaning wrong                 → PRD Production
resource requirement wrong                  → Production Assets
PRD acceptance/handoff wrong                → PRD Handoff
Voice scope/communication intent wrong       → Voice Requirements
Voice wording/performance/pronunciation      → Voice Production
Voice acceptance/delivery evidence wrong     → Voice Delivery
meaning correct, implementation wrong        → implementation owner
implementation correct, test stale           → test
implementation/test correct, CI wrong        → workflow / repository policy
derived artifact wrong                       → upstream canonical owner
```

Do not repair upstream defects with renderer defaults, generated-file patches, or compatibility layers.

## Canonical and derived state

```text
source / approved decisions
→ normalized state
→ canonical work
→ derived artifact
→ acceptance evidence
```

Never hand-patch generated `prd.html`, `context.md`, or `index.json` to hide an upstream defect.

## Repository continuity

- `CONTEXT.md` → stable product/repository orientation.
- `docs/knowledge/next-action.md` → active continuation only.
- `docs/knowledge/decisions/` → durable rationale.
- `docs/foundation/` → durable production policy.
- `kits/prd-creator/` → detailed production procedure and implementation.
- project package → project facts/state/output.
- reviews/history → evidence only when needed.

## Branches

```text
develop  → active repository development
Local    → verified integration baseline; develop→Local uses squash
main     → stable history; Local→main requires explicit stable promotion
```

After an approved `develop → Local` squash, synchronize `develop` to the resulting `Local` HEAD before new development. Version tags/releases are separate publishing actions for approved feature/capability changes.

## User-facing communication

Default to concise result-first reporting. Use the canonical workflow names above; do not translate them into numbered aliases.

## Product boundaries

- `kits/prd-creator/` is the single product package for Project Requirements through Voice Delivery, with Production Assets as a bounded capability.
- Project/PRD and Voice remain separate semantic domains.
- Root skills own reusable semantic judgment; package owners hold detailed procedure.
- `kits/prd-creator/AGENTS.md` owns package file/mechanical routing.
- Repository engineering owns shared dependency, regression, CI, and governance contracts.
- Live project packages are not tracked in the public system repository; `workspace/` is a local/external mount convention.

Stop when requested scope is complete and the cheapest sufficient evidence supports the claim.
