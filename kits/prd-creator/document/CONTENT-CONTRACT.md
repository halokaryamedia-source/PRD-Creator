# PRD Semantic Content Contract

`work/content.md` is the canonical owner of PRD meaning. `work/render-data.json` is a strict machine projection of that meaning. Generated HTML is presentation only.

This file owns **what the PRD must communicate**. Visual/page composition is owned by [DESIGN-CONTRACT.md](DESIGN-CONTRACT.md).

## Authority

Project meaning follows:

1. current explicit user instruction;
2. approved project decisions;
3. current authoritative source;
4. exact ready Project Requirements revision;
5. representation references only for structure/quality.

Every material concern must resolve as:

```text
Defined | Explicit No | Not Applicable | Blocked
```

## Material conservation

PRD Production may rewrite wording and choose representation inside approved surfaces. It may not delete independently actionable meaning for brevity or sample-count fidelity.

Conserve every resolved rule that changes production or observable behavior, including conditions/exceptions, timing/counts, scoring/results, fail/retry/recovery, reset/interruption, shared/local ownership, build/spatial constraints, approved technical constraints, and required player-visible/system results.

Do not reintroduce incidental as-built evidence intentionally excluded by Project Requirements unless it is an approved constraint.

## Semantic document family

The generated PRD retains its approved document structure and ordinals. These ordinals are presentation order, not workflow names.

```text
Overview
Gameplay Flow
Development
Gameplay Packages
Production Assets when present
```

For `N` gameplay packages, PRD-core page count remains `6 + 4N`; child-card/beat/note counts are data-driven.

## Stable semantic questions

Overview must establish Session Model, Target Playtime, Game Structure, chronological journey summary, and project-wide gameplay direction.

Gameplay Overview keeps:

```text
Gameplay Context
Main Objective
Result
```

Gameplay Information keeps:

```text
Game Purpose
Gameplay Time
Starting Condition
End Condition
Fail Condition
Scoring Criteria / Completion Result
```

Result mode remains explicit:

```text
scored | completion_only
```

Level Design communicates spatial/build responsibility, design flow, complete build requirements, and applicable constraints.

Developer communicates runtime responsibility, lifecycle, implementation requirements, result handling, interruption/reset/reuse/handoff, and runtime invariants.

## Adaptive cardinality

Use the smallest child cardinality that preserves all material distinctions. Do not add filler to match reference counts or merge distinct rules merely for compactness.

## Strict projection boundary

```text
Project Requirements revision
+ content.md bytes
→ strict render-data vocabulary
→ deterministic renderer
```

The projection must bind `canonical_content_sha256`, use only `shared/render_schema.py` fields, carry resolved result mode explicitly, preserve stable IDs, and maintain bilingual numeric/identity invariants when applicable.

The renderer must not recover historical aliases, infer missing semantic meaning, create scoring/completion meaning, or copy Golden sample facts.

If canonical meaning is incomplete, return the affected slice to **Project Requirements**. If meaning is complete but cannot fit the approved presentation grammar, the design/projection layer is the first wrong owner.

## Writing

Prefer direct subject/action/result wording, specific project nouns, semantic note titles, chronological flow when chronology matters, and detail in the owning role. Avoid generator narration, generic numbered note labels, vague ownership verbs, and repetitive cross-role restatement.

## PRD Production completion

PRD Production completes only when:

- Project Requirements remain bound to current requirement bytes;
- `content.md` satisfies this contract;
- `render-data.json` binds current content and requirement bytes;
- no material project decision was silently introduced;
- semantic cardinality is conserved;
- deterministic rendering succeeds;
- no unresolved placeholder remains.

**PRD Handoff**, not renderer success, decides accepted production readiness.
