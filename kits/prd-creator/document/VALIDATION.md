# PRD Handoff

`CONTENT-CONTRACT.md` owns semantic completeness. `DESIGN-CONTRACT.md` owns approved page/component grammar. This file owns the proof required to accept one current PRD revision and hand it downstream.

Mechanical implementation routing:

- `../validator/api.py` → complete PRD validation API;
- `../validator/prd_validation_engine.py` → source/projection/business checks;
- `../validator/html_contract.py` → derived HTML freshness/composition/navigation;
- `../shared/acceptance.py` → acceptance label/SHA primitives;
- `../validator/validate_handoff.py` → PRD Handoff gate.

## Sequence

```text
current Project Requirements revision
+ content.md
+ strict render-data projection
+ Production Assets source when present
→ mechanical validation
→ integrated semantic reconciliation/readiness
→ Material Conservation
→ targeted visual sanity when claimed
→ development_ready | handoff_ready
```

`development_ready` means current PRD/Production Assets meaning is accepted for implementation. `handoff_ready` additionally binds that revision to the current versioned delivery and is required before Voice Requirements.

## Mechanical validation

Run:

```bash
python kits/prd-creator/validator/validate.py workspace/active/<project>/
```

Mechanical validation proves deterministic facts including:

- Project Requirements binding matches current requirement bytes;
- render-data binds that exact revision and current `content.md` bytes;
- retained source provenance/hashes remain coherent;
- strict render schema and result mode are valid;
- Production Assets source is parseable and uses accepted Owner/Moment/Asset identity;
- generated HTML binds exact current canonical inputs;
- page/navigation/component markers and duplicate-ID/scoring checks remain valid.

Mechanical PASS does not prove semantic fidelity or browser visual quality.

## Integrated semantic readiness

Review relevant concerns once: source fidelity, decision completeness, new-reader clarity, Level Design actionability, Developer actionability, quantitative/lifecycle coherence, cross-role coherence, content purity, and design placement.

```text
Semantic Readiness: PASS | FAIL
```

## Semantic reconciliation

```text
Project Requirements
→ content.md
→ strict render-data projection
→ visible PRD + Production Assets
```

Look for material LOSS, CONTRADICTION, UNSUPPORTED meaning, AMBIGUITY, or CROSS-ROLE DRIFT.

## Material Conservation

Verify changed/regenerated scope retains every resolved material condition, value, exception, recovery rule, result behavior, technical constraint, and role-owned requirement.

```text
Material Conservation: PASS | FAIL
```

## Visual sanity

Visual `PASS` requires actual rendered/browser evidence. Static HTML inspection may establish structure/freshness only. Scale browser proof to the actual changed surface.

## Acceptance record

`work/acceptance.md` authorizes exact bytes:

```text
# PRD Acceptance
Status: needs_revision | development_ready | handoff_ready
Mechanical: PASS | FAIL
Semantic Readiness: PASS | FAIL
Material Conservation: PASS | FAIL
Visual sanity: PASS | FAIL | NOT PROVEN
Findings: <only when findings exist>
Critical: N
Major: N
Accepted Render Data SHA256: <exact work/render-data.json SHA-256>
Accepted Asset Requirements SHA256: <exact work/asset-requirements.md SHA-256 | none>
```

Any edit to Render Data or Production Assets after review invalidates acceptance even if `document.version` is unchanged.

## Handoff

Only `handoff_ready` crosses into **Voice Requirements**.

```bash
python kits/prd-creator/validator/validate_handoff.py workspace/active/<project>/
```

`state/handoff-state.yaml` stays minimal:

```yaml
status: handoff_ready
accepted_prd_version: <X.Y.Z>
```

Handoff validation proves the canonical PRD validator still passes, accepted version matches current render data, deterministic artifacts exist, output metadata identifies the same revision, and acceptance binds exact current Render Data + Production Assets bytes.

## Bounded revision

```text
approved change
→ first wrong owner
→ affected canonical source
→ deterministic rerender
→ mechanical validation
→ integrated review only for invalidated meaning
→ visual check only where changed/high-risk
→ new exact-byte acceptance
→ stop
```

Do not replay unaffected Project Requirements, packages, Voice, or Golden review for ceremony.
