# PRD-Creator

PRD-Creator is an AI-assisted production system for turning game-project evidence and discussion into a revision-bound approved project model, a development-ready PRD, required Production Assets, and optional downstream Voice Production.

## Canonical Workflow

```text
Project Setup
→ Project Requirements
→ PRD Production
   └─ Production Assets when required
→ PRD Handoff
→ Voice Requirements when Voice is justified
→ Voice Production
→ Voice Delivery
```

These names are used consistently in repository policy, package docs, and operator communication. Numbered stage aliases are not part of the current workflow vocabulary.

The generated PRD can still use numbered document navigation for Overview, Gameplay Flow, Development, and Production Assets; those numbers are layout order only.

## Input → Output

| Input | Processing | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Project discussion / current instruction | Project Requirements | approved requirement revision |
| Authoritative/reference sources | Project Requirements + PRD Production | canonical PRD meaning |
| Approved gameplay/build needs | Production Assets | actionable resource requirements |
| Approved Voice needs | Voice Requirements → Voice Production → Voice Delivery | Eleven v3-ready Voice Production |

Normal delivery:

```text
output/
├── README.md
└── v<document.version>/
    ├── prd.html
    ├── context.md
    └── index.json
```

Generated delivery is never source of truth. Fix the first wrong canonical owner and regenerate.

## Branch Model

```text
develop  → default active repository development
Local    → clean verified integration baseline; one commit per approved update
main     → stable repository history
```

Normal `develop` → `Local` promotion uses a verified squash boundary. `Local` → `main` remains explicit stable promotion. Version tags/releases are created only for approved feature/capability releases.

Repository behavior is routed by [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); GitHub execution policy by [GITHUB_RULES.md](GITHUB_RULES.md).

## Developer Quick Start

Prerequisite: **Python 3.11**.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.lock.txt -r requirements-dev.lock.txt
python -m pip check
python tools/verify_repository.py
ruff format --check kits/prd-creator tests tools
ruff check kits/prd-creator tests tools
mypy kits/prd-creator/shared kits/prd-creator/renderer kits/prd-creator/validator
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_prd_*.py" -v
```

Generate / validate a project:

```bash
python kits/prd-creator/renderer/delivery.py workspace/active/<project>/
python kits/prd-creator/validator/validate.py workspace/active/<project>/
```

Project packages under `workspace/active/` / `workspace/archive/` are local/external production data and are not tracked in this public system repository.

## Package Architecture

```text
kits/prd-creator/
├─ intake/              Project Requirements
├─ document/            PRD Production + PRD Handoff
├─ production-assets/   Production Assets
├─ voice/               Voice Requirements + Voice Production + Voice Delivery
├─ shared/              strict machine contracts
├─ renderer/            deterministic rendering + transactional delivery
├─ validator/           canonical mechanical gates
└─ template/            protected Golden/runtime bytes
```

Core machine invariants remain unchanged:

```text
requirement-register bytes → approved_requirement_sha256
content.md bytes           → render-data.canonical_content_sha256
Owner ID → Moment ID       → AST / VO resource identity
PRD Handoff                → exact render-data + asset-requirements bindings
Voice Delivery             → exact voice-production binding
```

## Repository Map

```text
.agents/skills/      reusable semantic judgment
docs/foundation/     durable production policy
docs/knowledge/      continuation, ownership, decisions, evidence
kits/prd-creator/    production procedure + implementation
tests/               executable regression contracts
tools/               repository verification/operator facade
workspace/           local/external project-package mount convention
.github/             CI / ownership / release policy
```

## Working Principle

```text
identify mode
→ find first wrong/changed owner
→ read only required context
→ update canonical source
→ regenerate derived output once
→ run the proof that can falsify the changed claim
→ stop
```
