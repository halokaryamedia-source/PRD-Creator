# Repository Ownership

Updated: 2026-09-09

Use only to answer **who owns what**. Exact field/schema/procedure contracts remain in the named owners.

## Canonical workflow names

```text
Project Setup
→ Project Requirements
→ PRD Production
   └─ Production Assets when required
→ PRD Handoff
→ Voice Requirements
→ Voice Production
→ Voice Delivery
```

Use these names in all current ownership/routing language. Numbered document/file markers are ordering only.

## Root owners

| Boundary | Owner |
|---|---|
| Project Setup / work modes / boot / authority / continuity / skill budget | `AGENTS.md` |
| GitHub mutation/history/CI/safety | `GITHUB_RULES.md` |
| Stable repository/product orientation | `CONTEXT.md` |
| Active continuation | `docs/knowledge/next-action.md` |
| Source/state precedence | `docs/knowledge/source-authority.md` |
| Durable decisions/rationale | `docs/knowledge/decisions/` |
| Current validation evidence | `docs/knowledge/reviews/current-validation.md` |

## Product/package owners

| Boundary | Owner |
|---|---|
| Reusable Project Requirements / PRD Production / Production Assets / PRD Handoff semantic judgment | `.agents/skills/project-document-production/SKILL.md` |
| Reusable Voice Requirements / Voice Production / Voice Delivery semantic judgment | `.agents/skills/voice-production/SKILL.md` |
| Package file/mechanical routing | `kits/prd-creator/AGENTS.md` |
| End-to-end Production Execution | `kits/prd-creator/SKILL.md` |
| Project Requirements procedure | `kits/prd-creator/intake/SOURCE-INTAKE.md` |
| PRD semantic completeness | `kits/prd-creator/document/CONTENT-CONTRACT.md` |
| Golden page/component grammar | `kits/prd-creator/document/DESIGN-CONTRACT.md` |
| Production Assets contract | `kits/prd-creator/production-assets/CONTRACT.md` |
| PRD Handoff | `kits/prd-creator/document/VALIDATION.md` |
| Renderer/delivery contract | `kits/prd-creator/renderer/CONTRACT.md` |
| Voice Requirements | `kits/prd-creator/voice/EXTRACTION.md` |
| Voice Production | `kits/prd-creator/voice/PERFORMANCE-WRITING.md` |
| Voice Delivery | `kits/prd-creator/voice/VALIDATION.md` |

`CONTENT-CONTRACT.md` owns what meaning survives. `DESIGN-CONTRACT.md` owns how accepted meaning is represented. Machine schemas do not own product meaning.

| Voice Delivery acceptance | `work/voice-acceptance.md` |
| Voice lifecycle state | `state/voice-state.yaml` |
| derived delivery | `output/README.md` + `output/v<document.version>/...` |

Derived output is never hand-patched to reconcile owners. Fix the first wrong canonical/contract owner and regenerate.
