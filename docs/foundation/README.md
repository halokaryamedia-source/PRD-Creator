# Production Foundation

This folder owns durable workflow/product policy. Active task state belongs in `../knowledge/next-action.md`.

## Current notes

Numeric filename prefixes are **ordering only**. Current workflow names are semantic and are used consistently in policy, routing, handoff, and operator communication.

| File | Canonical boundary |
|---|---|
| `00-product-boundaries.md` | Product Boundaries |
| `01-production-flow.md` | Canonical Workflow |
| `02-source-intake-recovery.md` | Project Requirements |
| `03-prd-generation.md` | PRD Production |
| `04-prd-validation-handoff.md` | PRD Handoff |
| `05-voice-requirement-extraction.md` | Voice Requirements |
| `06-elevenlabs-script-production.md` | Voice Production |
| `07-voice-validation-delivery.md` | Voice Delivery |

Production Assets is a bounded capability used when the project requires concrete resources. Numeric section markers may appear in the generated PRD as visual ordering only; they are not capability names.

Do not use numbered stage aliases as active workflow terminology.

## Rule

Read only the note relevant to the active boundary. Do not use foundation files as running task logs.
