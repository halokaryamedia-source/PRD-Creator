# PRD Handoff

Status: active policy

PRD Handoff validates and accepts one exact current PRD revision for implementation and optional downstream Voice work.

## Inputs

```text
current Project Requirements revision
+ work/content.md
+ work/render-data.json
+ Production Assets source when present
+ current deterministic project delivery
```

## Validation

PRD Handoff combines:

- canonical mechanical validation;
- integrated semantic reconciliation;
- Material Conservation;
- visual evidence when visual readiness is claimed;
- exact-byte acceptance.

Mechanical PASS does not prove semantic fidelity or browser visual quality.

## Semantic reconciliation

Compare:

```text
Project Requirements
→ canonical PRD meaning
→ strict render projection
→ visible PRD + Production Assets
```

Look for material loss, contradiction, unsupported meaning, ambiguity, or cross-role drift.

## Acceptance

`work/acceptance.md` binds exact current bytes:

```text
Accepted Render Data SHA256: <sha256>
Accepted Asset Requirements SHA256: <sha256 | none>
```

`development_ready` means current PRD/Production Assets meaning is accepted for implementation.

`handoff_ready` additionally proves the accepted revision matches current versioned delivery and may enter **Voice Requirements**.

## Handoff state

```yaml
status: handoff_ready
accepted_prd_version: <X.Y.Z>
```

Artifact locations remain deterministic and are not duplicated into handoff state.

## Bounded revision

```text
approved change
→ first wrong owner
→ affected canonical source
→ deterministic rerender
→ mechanical validation
→ semantic/visual review only where invalidated
→ new exact-byte acceptance
→ stop
```

Do not replay unaffected Project Requirements, Golden review, or Voice work for ceremony.
